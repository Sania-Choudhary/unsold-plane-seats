# Is it rude to move to an unsold plane seat?
This is a markdown file for the data of flight ettiquette from a survey by FiveThirtyEight and a bar chart showing the distribution of repsonses to one of the survey questions which asked if it is rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane.
## Interesting aspects of dataset and question
This dataset is interesting to use because it has a high number of recorded responses. I also liked the selection of questions they asked because many of them are ones I have often wondered myself while on flights in the past.

I was especially interested in this question because I boarded in international flight a few weeks ago that was mostly empty, so passengers moved around within the economy section so almost all rows had one person, maximum two people, in them. However, flight attendants soon made everyone move back to their original seats saying this moving around would disturb other passengers, though it worked out in almost everyone's benefit. I was curious to see how passengers actually felt about moving around to unsold plane seats. 
## Chart findings
It was very interesting to me to see that the vast majority of respondents (690/855) believed that moving to unsold seats on a plane is not rude at all. Some respondents believed it was somewhat rude (128/855) and comparatively few thought it was very rude (37/855). These findings reveal that overall, a majority of flight passengers do not consider it rude for passengers to move from their seat to an unsold plane seat.
